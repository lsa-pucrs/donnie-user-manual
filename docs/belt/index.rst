Donnie Vibrating Belt 
===============

With the goal of improving the quality of life of people with visual 
impairment and helping their mobility through a better perception of 
the environment it was created a tactile belt. Capable of working with 
different intensities, the tactile belt makes the user perceive, through 
vibrations, the approaching of an object. Initially the belt counted on 
a Kinect sensor to “see” the environment around and to identify obstacles. 
It also had 35 motors that covered the abdomen, vibrating as information 
was received.
Now the belt was adapted and implanted in the Donnie Project and has 12 motors. 
It has four types of vibration and it’s connected with the Donnie robot and with 
the simulation robot. The belt allows the person to perceive through vibrations 
the distance of the objects around the robot.
