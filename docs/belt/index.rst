Donnie Vibrating Belt 
===============

With the goal of improving the quality of life of people with visual impairment and helping their mobility through a better perception of the environment it was created a tactile belt. Capable of working with different intensities, the tactile belt makes the user perceive, through vibrations, the approaching of an object. Initially the belt counted on a Kinect sensor to “see” the environment around and to identify obstacles. It also had 35 engines that covered the abdomen, vibrating as information was received.
Now the belt was adapted and implanted in the Donnie Project and has 14 engines. It has four types of vibration and it’s connected with the Donnie robot and with the simulation robot. The belt allows the person to perceive through vibrations the distance of the objects around the robot.
